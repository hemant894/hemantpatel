System.out.println("What is Adhoc Testing?");

System.out.println("When to execute Adhoc Testing<");
System.out.println("==> Ad hoc testing can be performed when there is limited time to do elaborative testing.");
System.out.println("==> Usually adhoc testing is performed after the formal test execution.");
System.out.println("==> And if time permits, Ad hoc testing can be done on the system.");
System.out.println("==> Ad hoc testing will be effective only if the tester is knowledgeable of the system under the test. ");
System.out.println("$$$ Basically Adhoc testing is there are no Documentation, no Test Design or No Test case");
